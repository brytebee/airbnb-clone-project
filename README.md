# airbnb-clone-project
The Airbnb Clone Project is a comprehensive, real-world application designed to simulate the development of a robust booking platform like Airbnb. It involves a deep dive into full-stack development, focusing on backend systems, database design, API development, and application security.

## Goals
This project would help me practice how to handle the following:

- User Management: Implement a secure system for user registration, authentication, and profile management.
- Property Management: Develop features for property listing creation, updates, and retrieval.
- Booking System: Create a booking mechanism for users to reserve properties and manage booking details.
- Payment Processing: Integrate a payment system to handle transactions and record payment details.
- Review System: Allow users to leave reviews and ratings for properties.
- Data Optimization: Ensure efficient data retrieval and storage through database optimizations.

## Technologies
- DDjango: A high-level Python web framework used for building the RESTful API.
- Django REST Framework: Provides tools for creating and managing RESTful APIs.
- PostgreSQL: A powerful relational database used for data storage.
- GraphQL: Allows for flexible and efficient querying of data.
- Celery: For handling asynchronous tasks such as sending notifications or processing payments.
- Redis: Used for caching and session management.
- Docker: Containerization tool for consistent development and deployment environments.
- CI/CD Pipelines: Automated pipelines for testing and deploying code changes.

## Team Roles
- **Business Analyst (BA):** Analyzes customer workflows and translates business needs into technical requirements that development teams can implement.
- **Product Owner (PO):** Defines the product vision and strategy while managing the backlog to ensure the final product meets customer requirements.
- **Project Manager (PM):** Ensures projects are delivered on time and within budget while coordinating team activities and maintaining communication between stakeholders.
- **UI/UX Designer:** Creates user-friendly interfaces and designs optimal user journeys to maximize engagement and conversion rates.
- **Software Architect:** Designs high-level system architecture and makes executive technical decisions about tools, platforms, and code quality standards.
- **Software Developer:** Writes and engineers the actual application code, whether front-end, back-end, or full-stack implementation.
- **Quality Assurance (QA) Engineer:** Tests applications to verify they meet functional and non-functional requirements while identifying and reporting defects.
- **Test Automation Engineer:** Develops automated testing scripts and frameworks to enable faster, more reliable continuous testing.
- **DevOps Engineer:** Bridges development and operations teams by building CI/CD pipelines and automating the software delivery process.

## Database Design
- User Management: A User can have multiple Properties and Bookings.
- Property Management: A Property belong to a User and can have multiple Bookings.
- Booking System: Users can reserve properties and manage booking details.
- Payment Processing: A payment relates to Booking and User.
- Review System: Users can leave reviews and ratings for properties.
- Data Optimization: Data retrieval and storage is optimized.

## Feature Breakdown
**User Authentication**

Endpoints: /users/, /users/{user_id}/

Features: Register new users, authenticate, and manage user profiles.

**Property Management**

Endpoints: /properties/, /properties/{property_id}/

Features: Create, update, retrieve, and delete property listings.

**Booking System**

Endpoints: /bookings/, /bookings/{booking_id}/

Features: Make, update, and manage bookings, including check-in and check-out details.

**Payment Processing**

Endpoints: /payments/

Features: Handle payment transactions related to bookings.

**Review System**

Endpoints: /reviews/, /reviews/{review_id}/

Features: Post and manage reviews for properties.

**Database Optimizations**

Indexing: Implement indexes for fast retrieval of frequently accessed data.

Caching: Use caching strategies to reduce database load and improve performance.


## API Security
- **Authentication:** with JSON web tokens
- **Authorization:** define User roles and permissions
- **Rate Limiting:** Limit calls per minute to the API
